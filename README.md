# StudentSelect
Picks a student from a weighted list. The less vocal students are weighted heavier (will be picked more often).

I created this tool to more evenly spread class participation for my webdev class. 
Our instructor wanted to hear from everyone without picking on anyone. This tool gave everyone a chance to participate -- and in some cases forced them too >:)
